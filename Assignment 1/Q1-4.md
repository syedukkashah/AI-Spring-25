# Question 1 -> Analysis of Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"

## Objections That Still Carry Weight
Turing discussed several objections to machine intelligence, including the theological objection, the argument from consciousness, the mathematical objection, and arguments based on informality of behavior. Some of these continue to be relevant today:

- **The Argument from Consciousness**: Though AI has progressed in mimicking human responses, the difference between mere syntactic processing and genuine semantic comprehension continues to be a core challenge. Thinkers such as John Searle, with his Chinese Room Argument, contend that AI can mimic understanding without actually possessing it.
- **The Mathematical Objection**: Turing recognized that Gödel's incompleteness theorem indicates there will always be problems that formal systems, including digital computers, cannot resolve. This insight continues to be significant in AI research, as no AI system can achieve complete generality.
- **The Argument from Informality of Behavior**:  Human intelligence frequently depends on intuition and decision-making based on context that does not adhere to set rules. Even with advancements in machine learning, modern AI still faces challenges in grasping nuances and applying knowledge across various domains.

## Validity of Turing’s Refutations
Turing effectively refuted several objections, but some of his counterarguments invite further scrutiny:

- **The Theological Objection**: Turing dismissed the argument that intelligence is linked to a soul by highlighting that omnipotence should allow God to bestow intelligence upon machines. This refutation holds well, as intelligence is now understood as an emergent property rather than an exclusive trait of human souls.
- **The "Heads in the Sand" Objection**: Turing dismissed the fear of machine intelligence as mere wishful thinking. His argument is still valid, as AI development should be guided by ethical considerations rather than fear-based opposition.
- **Lady Lovelace’s Objection (Machines Cannot Originate Anything)**: Turing suggested that machines have the potential to astonish us, asserting that creativity may not be exclusively human. Contemporary AI, especially generative models such as GPT and DALL·E, reinforce Turing’s assertion by producing surprising and original results.

## New Objections Arising from Developments
Since Turing’s time, AI has evolved significantly, introducing new challenges:

- **The Alignment Problem**: AI systems, especially deep learning models, operate as black boxes, making it difficult to align their objectives with human values and ensure ethical behavior.
- **Bias and Fairness Issues**: AI systems inherit biases from training data, leading to ethical concerns about fairness, accountability, and discrimination.
- **Computational and Energy Constraints**: The increasing computational power required for AI models raises concerns about sustainability and efficiency.

## Evaluating Turing’s 2000 Prediction
Turing predicted that by the year 2000, a machine would have a 30% chance of passing a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator. This prediction was not entirely accurate, but it was not entirely wrong either:

Some chatbots, such as those competing in the Loebner Prize, have fooled interrogators in brief conversations. However, these systems rely on tricks rather than genuine understanding.
While chatbots like ChatGPT can generate human-like responses, they still lack true comprehension and reasoning ability. Thus, while AI has achieved superficial success in passing limited Turing Tests, it does not yet exhibit human-like intelligence. However, It is my personal opinion that even with all these flaws, modern AI, that is being refined with improved models, with the right prompt engineering, could easily pass a five-minute Turing Test with an unskilled interrogator


# Question 2 -> AI Capabilities and Challenges in Various Tasks

## Introduction
As of February 2025, the capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics have advanced significantly, enabling machines to perform a variety of complex tasks. Below is an assessment of whether computers can currently accomplish the specified tasks, along with an analysis of the challenges associated with tasks that remain infeasible.

## Task Feasibility Analysis

### 1. Playing a Decent Game of Table Tennis (Ping-Pong)
AI-controlled robots have made notable progress in playing table tennis. Robotic systems equipped with advanced sensors and real-time processing can engage in rallies with human players. There have also been developments in Asia where footballers like Messi have been challenged to score against a robot keeper, so it an AI playing decent ping pong is not out of reach. However, achieving a level of play comparable to skilled human players remains challenging due to the rapid reflexes, precise control, and adaptability required. The primary difficulties include real-time perception, dynamic motion planning, and handling the high-speed interactions inherent in table tennis.

### 2. Playing a Decent Game of Bridge at a Competitive Level
AI has demonstrated proficiency in playing bridge at a competitive level. Programs like GIB (Goren-Inspired Bidding) have been used in online bridge platforms, and AI systems have competed in human tournaments. The complexity of bridge, with its incomplete information and need for strategic bidding and play, presents challenges that AI has managed to address through advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques.

### 3. Writing an Intentionally Funny Story
While AI language models can generate coherent narratives, producing intentionally humorous content remains a significant challenge. Humor involves complex linguistic nuances, cultural context, and an understanding of human emotions, which AI currently lacks. Attempts to create funny stories often result in content that may be syntactically correct but falls short of genuine humor. The difficulty lies in the AI's inability to grasp subtleties, double meanings, and the social context that humor often requires. AI does not understand when and where to emphasize on certain phrases amd words and when to strategically pause in it's statements to increase humor in it's language model

### 4. Giving Competent Legal Advice in a Specialized Area of Law
AI systems have been developed to assist with legal research and document review, offering preliminary insights based on vast legal databases. There have been recent reports that US lawyers are facing scrutiny over AI generated court filings. However, providing competent legal advice, especially in specialized areas, requires deep understanding, interpretation of nuanced legal principles, and consideration of specific client circumstances. AI lacks the ability to fully comprehend context, interpret the law dynamically, and apply judgment, which are essential for competent legal counsel.

### 5. Discovering and Proving a New Mathematical Theorem
AI has contributed to mathematics by verifying proofs and exploring conjectures. Notably, AI systems have assisted in proving existing theorems and identifying patterns. However, the autonomous discovery and proof of entirely new, non-trivial mathematical theorems remain beyond current AI capabilities. This task requires deep intuition, creativity, and the ability to conceptualize abstract ideas—qualities that AI has yet to replicate. 

### 6. Performing a Surgical Operation
Robotic-assisted surgery has become increasingly common, with systems like the da Vinci Surgical System enabling surgeons to perform precise operations. These robots act as extensions of the surgeon, who controls them remotely. Fully autonomous surgical robots are still in the experimental stage and face challenges related to real-time decision-making, handling unexpected complications, and ensuring patient safety. The complexities of human anatomy and the need for adaptive responses during surgery make full automation difficult.

### 7. Unloading Any Dishwasher in Any Home
General-purpose household robots capable of unloading any dishwasher in any home do not yet exist. The variability in kitchen layouts, dishwasher models, and item placements presents significant challenges for AI and robotics. Tasks that are simple for humans, such as recognizing and handling diverse objects, require advanced perception, manipulation, and adaptability that current robots lack. However, with new inventions like th robot vaccum cleaner and AI powered toilet seats, it's only a matter of time before dishwashing is automated.

### 8. Constructing a Building
While automation and robotics have been integrated into construction processes (e.g., bricklaying robots, 3D printing of building components), the complete construction of a building involves complex tasks such as project planning, adapting to site-specific conditions, and coordinating various trades. These require a level of flexibility, problem-solving, and oversight that current AI and robotic systems do not possess.
